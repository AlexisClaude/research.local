# Local Research

## Goal
Create a web interface for a local LLM that can generate answers using internet access. The system should offer three levels of depth:
1. Quick Answer: A concise response supported by fewer than five sources for a given question.
2. Intermediate Answer: A detailed response requiring between two and five sections of research.
3. Deep Answer: A comprehensive report on a specific topic, drawn from multiple sources.

## Tools
- **Hugging Face** – To load and run local LLMs using the MLX framework and compatible inference libraries.
- **SearXNG** – A metasearch engine to aggregate results from multiple search providers.
